Deployed a secure static website leveraging AWS services: Amazon S3 for hosting static content, Route 53 for domain management with an alias record, AWS Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS certificate provisioning, and Amazon CloudFront as a content delivery network for caching and distributing the website with the provisioned SSL certificate, providing a high-performance and secure user experience.
